# Overview of Power BI Dashboard and Sales Forecasting

In this project, I developed an interactive sales dashboard and implemented a 30-day sales forecasting model using the dataset (`SuperStore_Sales_Dataset.csv`) sourced from **Kaggle**, utilizing** Microsoft Power BI** for both data transformation and visualization.

The objective was to create a comprehensive visual tool for business decision-makers to explore sales patterns, filter performance across regions and timeline, and predict upcoming sales volumes.

### Key Highlights :

* **Data Cleaning** and transformation performed inside Power BI, documented clearly for transparency.
* Created a **dynamic dashboard** with filters for region and timeline.
* **Map visualizations** display sales and profit distribution across U.S. states.
* Dashboard supports exploration across :

  * Product Category & Sub-Category
  * Segment & Region
  * Payment & Shipping Mode
    
* Enables users to interactively explore data trends and export visual insights.
